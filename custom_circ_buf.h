  On some microcontrollers you may want to use uint8_t for the buffer indexes, whereas on x64 you may prefer size_t.

// defines the types of variables used to perform computation on indexes. Must be able to store up to twice the number of items in the buffer (of type CCBFsize_t).
// example: if the number of items in the buffer never exceeds 128, even uint8_t can suffice for CCBFbigsize_t. But if you're planning to store 200 items in the buffer, you'll have to use uint16_t for CCBFbigsize_t (2 * 200 = 400 > 255).
